    <h1> Kale Salad Recipe </h1>
    <img src="..images/Kale-salad.png" alt="This is a picture of finished Kale Salad">
<p> This is a recipe that is going to give you clear instructions on how to make Kale Salad from scratch. This recipe is going to yield 4 standard servings.
    To cook different amounts of servings just adjust the ingredients to the portions you desire. Note: Since kale will wilt relatively quickly, it’s 
    best to enjoy this kale salad with lemon vinaigrette the day you make it. If you have leftovers, though, you can store them in an airtight container 
    in the refrigerator for up to two days. </p>
