    <img src="..images/smash-burgers.png" alt="This is a picture of finished smash burger">
<p> This is a recipe that is going to give you clear instructions on how to make smash burgers from scratch. This recipe is going to yield 4 standard servings.
    To cook different amounts of servings just adjust the ingredients to the portions you desire.  </p>
<h2> Ingredients</h2>
<ul> 
    <ul1>4 hamburger buns</ul1>
    <ul2>2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as needed </ul2>
    <ul3>1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean) </ul3>
    <ul4>1/4 cup olive oil</ul4>
    <ul5>4 (6-inch) squares parchment paper</ul5>
    <ul6>salt to taste</ul6>
    <ul7>4 slices American cheese </ul7>
    <ul8>burger toppings of choice</ul8>
</ul>

<h2> Steps</h2>
<ol> 
<ol1><h3> Prepare Outdoor Grill</h3>> Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and 
    lightly oil the grate. Set a cast iron flat-top griddle or large cast 
    iron skillet onto the grill and preheat until smoking. </ol1>
<ol2>Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until lightly browned. Set aside. </ol2>
<ol3>
    <h3>Smashing the meat</h3> 
    <p> Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. Do not pack the meat tightly, as this will prevent it from smashing properly.</p> 
    <p> Place each ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment (to prevent sticking to the spatula; re-use each parchment square on a second patty) 
        and immediately smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff, sturdy spatulas that are criss-crossed to get proper leverage as you press down. 
        You may also use the bottom of small skillet.
    </p>
    <p>Sprinkle the meat with salt.</p>

</ol3>

<ol4>Cooking Process 
<p>Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are a light pink color.</p>
<p> Using a bench scraper or firm spatula, gently scrape up the patties, flip over and immediately cover 4 of them with cheese.</p>
<p> Grill an additional 15 to 20 seconds; stack the plain patties over the cheese-covered patties so you have 4 stacks.</p>
<p>Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favorite toppings. </p>
